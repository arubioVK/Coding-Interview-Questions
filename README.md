### Interleaving strings

```plain
Given A, B, C, find whether C is formed by the interleaving of A and B.

Input Format:*

The first argument of input contains a string, A.
The second argument of input contains a string, B.
The third argument of input contains a string, C.
Output Format:

Return an integer, 0 or 1:
    => 0 : False
    => 1 : True
Constraints:

1 <= length(A), length(B), length(C) <= 150
Examples:

Input 1:
    A = "aabcc"
    B = "dbbca"
    C = "aadbbcbcac"

Output 1:
    1
    
Explanation 1:
    "aa" (from A) + "dbbc" (from B) + "bc" (from A) + "a" (from B) + "c" (from A)

Input 2:
    A = "aabcc"
    B = "dbbca"
    C = "aadbbbaccc"

Output 2:
    0

Explanation 2:
    It is not possible to get C by interleaving A and B.
```

### Majority Element

```plain
Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than floor(n/2) times.
You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

Example :

Input : [2, 1, 2]
Return  : 2 which occurs 2 times which is greater than 3/2.
```

### Rotate Matrix

```plain
You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image.

Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You need to do this in place.

Note that if you end up using an additional array, you will only receive partial score.

Example:

If the array is

[
    [1, 2],
    [3, 4]
]
Then the rotated array becomes:

[
    [3, 1],
    [4, 2]
]
```
